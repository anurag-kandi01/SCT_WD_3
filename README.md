This project is a simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows:

. Two players to play against each other on the same device.

. A single player vs computer (CPU) with random move logic.

The game interface is responsive and easy to use. It tracks game state, displays the winner or a draw, and lets users reset the game anytime.
